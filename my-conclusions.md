My conclusions, Louise:

Task 1:
OOP side of the project is a lot less cluttered, making it easier to read.

Task 2:
Setting it up took a bit more time in OOP than in procedural, but readability is still better in OOP. Took about the same amount of lines of code.

Task 3:
Forgot to observe the changes, but was easier in OOP.

Extra:
Deleted Point from OOP as it was never used.
